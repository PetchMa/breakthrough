# Pulsar Searching

The search for engineered signals uses some of the same tools used to search for pulsars. 

If you're interested in some general information on pulsar search software from Scott Ransom and Ryan Lynch, as well as a tutorial for the tools on some of the calibrator data we obtain of pulsars with Breakthrough Listen at the GBT, check out [this folder.](GBT/pulsar_searches/Pulsar_Resources)

If you're interested in how a rudimentary pulsar search works without the fancy libraries you can check out this notebook! [this folder.](GBT/pulsar_searches/Pulsar_Search/README.md)
